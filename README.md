# Challenge_13_Venture_Funding
This is a Jupyter Notebook model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. This model creates a binary classification model using a deep neural network. This notebook consists of three technical deliverables which are Preprocessing the data for a neural network model, Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model, and Optimizeing the model.
